# Email Phishing Investigation & Containment Workflow

This repository documents a real-world phishing investigation performed from the perspective of a SOC analyst.

The focus of this project is **decision-making**, not tools.

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Email header analysis and authentication validation
- Identification of brand impersonation
- URL deception and infrastructure analysis
- IOC extraction and documentation
- SOC-style incident reporting

## What This Is NOT
- A malware detonation lab
- A VirusTotal screenshot dump
- A theoretical phishing explanation

## Workflow Used
Alert → Triage → Header Analysis → URL Analysis → Threat Classification → Containment

## Outcome
The email was confirmed as a phishing/scam message abusing the OTTO brand and using deceptive redirection infrastructure.
